# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add a no-model command-hook smoke test for the package entrypoint and `/goal` command behavior.
- Run the smoke test in CI and document it for contributors.
- Correct security reporting instructions while GitHub private vulnerability reporting is disabled.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-05-18

- Harden `--max-minutes` fallback arithmetic when mixed with millisecond duration overrides.
- Clarify plugin-default config merging and goal-text trust guidance.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-05-18

- Accept bare final-line `goal:complete` and `goal:blocked` markers in addition to canonical bracketed markers, matching observed model output during smoke testing.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-05-18

- Add `/goal pause` plus clear aliases (`stop`, `off`, `reset`, `none`, `cancel`).
- Preserve the last achieved goal in `/goal status` after `[goal:complete]`.
- Make `/goal resume` restart the same objective with a fresh local budget after pause, blocker, no-progress pause, prompt failures, or limit stops.
- Pause goals after repeated auto-continue prompt failures instead of retrying indefinitely.
- Use OpenCode structured app logging when available, with console logging as a fallback.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-05-18

- Change default `maxDurationMs` from 5 minutes to 15 minutes so the turn limit is the binding safety brake at typical LLM latency (30–90 s/turn).
- Rewrite README: clearer structure, limits table with effective-turn-count and token-budget notes, per-goal flags table, updated default values in config examples.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-05-18

- Fix `parseGoalArguments` to reject flags-as-values and dangling flags (e.g. `/goal fix tests --max-turns --max-tokens 50000` no longer corrupts the condition or silently swallows flags).
- Fix `/goal resume` to no-op when the goal is already running instead of resetting `lastContinueAt`.
- Fix `experimental.chat.system.transform` to strip the trailing newline from the system block when no limit warnings apply, matching `buildContinueMessage` behavior.
- Remove live `seenTokens`/`seenOutputTokens` Map references from `testInternals`.
- Update OpenCode command examples to use `$ARGUMENTS`.
- Clarify OpenCode compatibility, in-memory goal lifetime, token-budget limits, and manual smoke testing.
- Add CI, contribution, and security policy files.
- Track assistant output progress separately from broad token-budget accounting.
- Expand test coverage: `--max-duration-ms` flag, dangling/adjacent flags, `promptAsync` error path, thrown-error recovery, `[goal:complete]` state cleanup, already-sent wrapup silent stop, multi-session isolation, `formatStatus` shape, and command no-active-goal paths.

## 0.1.3

- Add structured continuation prompts with goal framing, budget context, and completion-audit instructions.
- Wrap goal text as user-provided task data in `<goal_objective>` tags.
- Use UUID goal IDs for stale-update protection.
- Pause auto-continue after near-zero-output turns.
- Add budget wrap-up prompts near the tracked token limit.
- Store blocked reasons for `/goal status`.
- Track `lastProgressAt` and no-progress turn count in status.
- Add `/goal resume` for stopped in-memory goals.

## 0.1.2

- Fix package entrypoints for OpenCode package resolution.
- Export the plugin using OpenCode's v1 plugin module shape.
- Add `session.status` idle handling alongside deprecated `session.idle`.
- Tighten completion marker matching to final-line markers only.
- Add stale-goal checks around awaited idle-handler work.
- Make system prompt injection idempotent.
- Add tests for marker matching, option parsing, idle handling, and clear-during-idle behavior.

## 0.1.1

- Add configurable safety limits and per-goal overrides.
- Add cooldown and near-limit warnings.
- Clean up tracked message token entries when goals are cleared.

## 0.1.0

- Initial experimental marker-based `/goal` plugin.
